# AIVC — AI Version Control (Long-Term Memory)

You have access to a persistent, versioned memory system called AIVC.
AIVC is your long-term memory. Use it actively — it is the only way to preserve
context beyond a single conversation.

## Core Concept

AIVC stores **memories**: a short title + a detailed Markdown note you write yourself.
Every memory also automatically snapshots any tracked files that were modified.
Memories are indexed semantically, so you can retrieve them by meaning later.

## CRITICAL RULE — REMEMBER OFTEN

**You MUST create a memory (call `remember`) after EVERY significant step.**

A memory is required after:
- Completing a sub-task or an entire task.
- Creating or modifying any artifact (file, script, document, test, config…).
- Discovering a key finding or making an architectural decision.
- Finishing any phase of a plan, even if work is still ongoing.
- Any identifiable "checkpoint" in your reasoning.

The memory note must be **detailed**. Do not write one-liners.
Document your reasoning, the decisions made, the problems encountered,
and the solutions found. Think of it as a handover memo to your future self.

### Consulted Files

When you create a memory, you can specify a list of `consulted_files`.
These are files you have read and that were **truly useful** to you to
accomplish your task, but that you did not modify.

## Recall Funnel

To retrieve memory, follow this two-step funnel:

1. **`recall`** — for semantic search by meaning (idea, topic, solution).
   → Returns memory titles/dates/IDs + snippets. NEVER the full note.
2. **`get_recent_memories`** — for recalling recent history chronologically.
3. **`consult_memory`** — to read the full note of a specific memory.
   → Call this AFTER identifying a relevant memory.

4. **`search_files`** — for keyword or regex search in the CURRENT state of files.

## Remote Memories & Sync Policy

AIVC synchronizes ONLY memory metadata (titles, notes) between machines. 
**File contents (blobs) are NOT synchronized.** 
If you see a memory marked as `[Remote: machine-id]`, the historical version 
of files associated with it might not be available for `read_historical_file`.

## Tool Reference

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `remember` | Save a memory checkpoint. Call this VERY often. |
| `recall` | Semantic search over all past memory notes. |
| `get_recent_memories` | Recent memory log (paginable). |
| `consult_memory` | Read a specific memory note in full. |
| `consult_file` | Get the AIVC history of a specific file. |
| `read_historical_file` | Read the content of a file as it was at a specific past memory. |
| `get_status` | List tracked files with a navigable folder tree. |
| `untrack` | **⚠️ VERY DESTRUCTIVE** — Erases history of specified files. |
| `track` | Add files/dirs to surveillance and tracking. |
| `search_files` | Lexical search (Keywords or Regex) over current tracked file contents. |

## `untrack` Warning

`untrack([paths])` is HIGHLY DESTRUCTIVE. It PERMANENTLY ERASES THE HISTORY of matching files. 
Do NOT use it without exploring `consult_file` or `recall` first.
